# Team Newbie Neurons

This repository contains both Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for the implementation of the Clinical Trial Recommendation System. 

## Contents

- **Python Scripts**: Located in the `Python Scripts` folder. These scripts can be executed directly in any Python environment.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Found in the `Python Notebooks` folder. These notebooks provide the same functionality as the Python scripts but include additional markdown documentation for better understanding.

## How to Use

You can choose to run either the Python scripts or the Jupyter notebooks, depending on your preference:

1. **Python Scripts**: 
   - Navigate to the `Python Scripts` folder.
   - Execute the desired script using a Python interpreter (e.g., `python script_name.py`).

2. **Jupyter Notebooks**: 
   - Navigate to the `Python Notebooks` folder.
   - Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or any compatible IDE.
   - Follow the provided markdown instructions for better insights into each step of the code.

Both approaches are identical in terms of functionality and code. Feel free to use whichever format suits your workflow!

## Additional Resources

- **Report**: A comprehensive report summarizing the system's architecture, methodology, and results (`report.pdf`).
- **Metric Evaluation**: Code for evaluating the system's performance (`metric_evaluation.py`).
- **Neo4j Graph Visualization**: An interactive visualization of the knowledge graph (`neo4j_graph_visualization.html`).
